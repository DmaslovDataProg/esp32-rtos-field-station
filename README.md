# esp32-rtos-field-station
An autonomous station that sends location, environmental data and streams it to a host via RF connection

## How to launch this code for just reading the output data on serial output from Ardruino:
1) TODO

## Demo of the functionality: 
TODO

## Hardware list: 
1) ESP32 Dev board
2) ESP32-CAM

## Limitations on the hardware: 
TODO


## Future implementations: 
1) Add non-RTOS funcionality
2) Add RTOS funcionality

## Lessons learned:
1) Always know which board you are having
2) Always verify which baud rate your sensor has, use simplier setups for that.
3) Always check all cables integrity, verify that USB cables actually send data.
4) Tx is connected to Rx on another side, not to Tx as well.
